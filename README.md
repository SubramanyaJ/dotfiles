## Usage

Use with proper care (and at your own risk!)
The `dependencies.sh` script installs the dependencies for Debian based systems.

If on a fresh Debian install, run the `fresh_install.sh` script to automate the basic setup. (Currently incomplete and undergoing improvisation).

## Notes

### Evremap
I broke the Tab key on my laptop, and Evremap helped me map the grave accent key to Tab.
Requires Rust to compile from source.
Comes with a daemon.

### i3
Minimal.
Fast.
Gives some homely vibe which is absent from Sway.

### kitty
The themes are cloned from a different repository and placed in the directory root.

### nvim
Lightweight autocomplete.
Works without a GUI as well.
Faster to work with.

### rofi
The themes come pre-loaded with the installation.

### zathura
The best.
